The command cd "" would take you to your root directory. The ~ symbol represents the home directory.

The l flag for the ls command will make the command respond in long format

I get the file name, size, blocks, IO block, device, inode, Links, access Uid, Gid, last time accessed, modified, changed, and birth of the file

ls -l gives the size, creation date and time, and the root directory for the file.
